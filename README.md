# Twitter-Hashtag-Mapping
Wrote a program that collects tweets with given keyword/ hashtag, processes them and maps the hashtags, user_name on map based on their given location.

To test it out, you will need a Twitter Dev Account(Free to register) and python.

Download the project.
Open in Google Colabs or Jupyter Notebook(this is what I did)
