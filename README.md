# Twitter-Hashtag-Mapping
Wrote a program that collects tweets with given keyword/ hashtag, processes them and maps the hashtags, user_name on map based on their given location.


**Go through the "Twee-Hash Main.ipynb" code file as it contains most of code documentation in form of comments. 

To test it out, you will need a Twitter Dev Account(Free to register) and python.

Download the project.
Open in Google Colabs or Jupyter Notebook(this is what I did)

I have documented the code as well as written down logic and  working of some self-made fuctions. 
I've made an active attempt to document it so it's simple to understand.
